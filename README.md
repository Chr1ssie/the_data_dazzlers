Project Idea: Airbnb Short-term rental pricing prediction

Project proposal: 
We will try solving, analyzing, or visualizing data concerning Airbnb listings in Paris as well as using machine learning (ML) for the price prediction.
We will focus on most affordable versus least affordable listings based on location and attractions for tourists.

Our visualization will be displayed using Tableau public

Lastly, an interactive map will be used for users interactions
